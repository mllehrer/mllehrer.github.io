<h2>Html and CSS cheat sheet</h2>
<p>Tonight, I fix my goddamn website.</p><br>
<p>Every element has an invisible box around it. You can make them visible by defining a border and padding. You can move them around on the page by specifying margins.</p>
<p>First of all, blocks vs. inline: block elements take up the full width of space available and start on a new line, while inline elements only happen within the line. So < h1> is a block element but < a> is an inline element.</p><br>
<p>When you're making a CSS stylesheet, the syntax goes:
  <code> element {
    property: value;
    property: value;
  }</code>
  <p>Please don't forget your semicolons. Someday, when you have time to edit the photo, this is going to have a background image. To stick that in and keep it fixed on the page, you're going to do</p>
    <code> body {
      background-image: url;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-position: fixed;
    }
  </code>
  <p>You were confused about em. 1em is equal to the current font size, in pixels. So if the font size is 16px, 1em = 16px. If you change the font size, you change em, so be careful. W3schools suggests changing the font-size to 100% and then just operating in em so probably do that.</p><br>
  <p>To format links:</p>
    <code>a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked</code>
<p> you can remove the underline by setting text-decoration to "none"</p>
<p>Border styles</p>
<code>dotted - Defines a dotted border<br>
dashed - Defines a dashed border<br>
solid - Defines a solid border<br>
double - Defines a double border<br>
groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value<br>
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value<br>
inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value<br>
outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value<br>
none - Defines no border<br>
hidden - Defines a hidden border<br>
</code>
<p>This should look better than the other pages.</p>
