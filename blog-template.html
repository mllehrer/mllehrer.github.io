<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was kind of difficult because design is in a lot of ways subjective. We could agree on what elements needed to be present in a good wireframe but ended up making a lot of tiny tweaks to the page. 
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
-yes! I like translating graphics into code. And I loved the tool we used: I'll probably buy a subscription to mockingbird if I keep working with web development. Great software.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
-easy to read
-easy to navigate
-clearly displays which elements go where, without being overly detailed
-suitable for the subject matter
-able to be executed within our allotted time at our current skill level
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ? 
I learned <figure> and <figcaption> and how to group elements in <article> and <header>. Having done a little work with HTML4 before this, I'm pleased with how much more senes semantic elements make, both writing and reading them.-->
