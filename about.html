  <h1>About Me</h1>
   <figure><img src="../imgs/soldiercreek.jpg?w=400&h=400"></figure>
<p>A Coloradan by birth, I got my B.S. in Earth Sciences at Duke University in North Carolina, and my M.S. in Geochemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I have recently relocated to the Bay Area where I am enjoying the moderate temperatures and great coffee.</p>
<p>I like to do all the usual outdoorsy things: rock climbing, hiking, bug-watching and snake-catching. My favorite sitting-down activities are reading and writing. After spending a year as the marketing coordinator for a pioneer museum, I've gotten pretty into historical sewing, too.</p>
<p>My "quirk" is that I love Pokemon! My favorite is #181, Ampharos.</p>
