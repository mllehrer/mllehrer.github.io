  <div id="header">Ruby hashes vs. JavaScript objects</div>
  <p>Both Ruby and JavaScript are object-oriented languages, which means they are composed of objects that have data and behavior, instead of just a set of procedures that access and use data. Ruby has two data types that act as lists: a data type called an array, which is an ordered list of values, and a hash, which is a list of ordered, unique keys that access values. A Ruby array looks like this:</p><br>
    <code>ruby_array = ["these", "are", "values", "numbered 0-3"]</code><br>
  <p>and a hash looks like this:</p><br>
    <code>corsola_hash = { name: "Corsola", animal: "Pokemon", number: 222 }</code><br>
    <p>A JavaScript array looks just like a Ruby array, but Javascript doesn't have a hash type of data structure. Instead, it can store data in an "object" which has "properties" -- properties that happen to look like the key-value pairs in a Ruby hash.</p><br>
    <code>var corsolaObject = {<br>
      name: "Corsola",<br>
      animal: "Pokemon",<br>
      number: 222<br>
  }</code><br>
  <p>JavaScript objects have a cool feature they do not share with Ruby hashes: they can be changed from anywhere in the program very simply. If you want to add a property to a JavaScript object, you just pretend it already exists. For instance, say we want to add Corsola's types to its object. Typing </p>
  <code>corsolaObject.type1 = "Water"</code> will add the "Water" type to the Corsola object.
