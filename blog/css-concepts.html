  <h2>Week 1: Version Control</h2>
  <h3>The mascot's pretty cute.</h3>
  <h4>10/5/2015</h4>
    <p>
      Version control is a way programmers can track changes in a program. Programs are often complex pieces of code with a lot of moving parts. It's easy to make mistakes and not always easy to find them. By using version control, programmers can get a better sense of where they went wrong when there is a bug, and they can also preserve a working, bug-free model to go back to. Git is a form of version-control software. By using commits, it allows "save points" in the code that you can fall back to if you make a mistake. It also allows branches, which can be worked on without affecting the main code, and then merged with the main ("master") branch of code when they are complete. </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is an online platform for git version control. Storing code on GitHub's servers backs it up and allows it to be edited by multiple people, who can make their own branches and then request to have them added back to the main code. By hosting code on servers, instead of on individual computers, the creation and editing process is made more collaborative.

  <h2>Week 3: CSS</h2>
  <h3>This should look better than it does.</h3>
  <h4>10/19/2015</h4>
      <div id="header">Margins, borders, and padding</div>
      <p>
      An object in html and CSS <div id="block">like this block</div> can have set properties. The previous block has 2 pixels of "padding," which determines where the text sits in the block. <div id="block-2">This block</div> has 10 pixels of padding on the bottom and no padding anywhere else, which moves the text to the top of the block, with ten pixels of space underneath it. Elements can also have borders around them, to help them stand out from other elements on the screen. <div id="block-3">This block</div> has a dotted border, because I think dots look fancy.
      <p>

  <p>
    Margins determine where the object is on the page. At the bottom of this page, regardless of where you scroll, you should see a black bar that is the "footer" bar of the page. I have fixed its position to maintain a margin of "0"--that is, to have no space--from the bottom of the page, which will always make it the last thing you see.
