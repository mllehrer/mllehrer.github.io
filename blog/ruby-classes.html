  <h2>Ruby Week 3</h2>
  <h3>Classy stuff</h3>
  <h4>10/25/2015</h4>
      <div id="header">Classes in Ruby</div>
      <p>Ruby is an object-oriented programming language; instead of building programs along procedures (if-then-else) alone, it is composed of a set of objects that have data and behavior. So within an object, there may be if-then-elses, and they can interact with other if-then-elses. In this way, programs can model the "real world" as a set of interactive objects, and can function in ways that a procedural program might not. A <em>class</em> is one way to build such objects.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>A class name should start with a capital letter.</li>
  <li>Classes can have "instance variables" that remain consistent unless changed throughout the class. These are denoted by an @ in front of the variable name.</li>
  <li>A class can be set up with these variables using an "initialize" method, like in the example below.</li>
  <li>Classes can have several methods. As a rule, though, if the methods start to diverge too much from each other, you should continue creating a new class to hold the most differing methods.</li>
  <li>Methods that can be called throughout the class (the same way instance variables can be) are called "instance" methods.</li>
  <li>Classes can make a bunch of objects. Let's make a Pokemon! How about Corsola, the cute little guy up top?</li>

  <code>
        class Pokemon<br>
        def initialize(name, number, type1, type2=nil) #some pokemon have two types and some only have one<br>
        @name = name<br>
        @number = number<br>
        @type1 = type1<br>
        @type2 = type2<br>
        end<br>
        #All of those are instance variables. Here's an instance method.<br>
        <br>

        def describe_pokemon<br>
          if @type2 == nil<br>
            puts "This new Pokemon is called #{@name} and is number #{@number} in the Pokedex! It's a #{type1} type."<br>
          else<br>
            puts "This new Pokemon is called #{@name} and is number #{@number} in the Pokedex! It's a #{type1} and #{type2} type."<br>
        end<br>
corsola = Pokemon.new("Corsola", 222, "water", "rock")<br>
corsola.describe_pokemon<br>
  "This new Pokemon is called Corsola and is number 222 in the Pokedex! It's a water and rock type."
  </code>
  <p>We made a Pokemon! We can make as many more as we want--and there are over 700 of them now.</p>
