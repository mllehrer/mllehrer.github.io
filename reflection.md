##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I had learned a lot about those subjects from the previous challenges. I actually found the devtools exercise to be the most helpful in seeing those changes in real time.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I always wondered how to make headers that don't move, sidebars that don't move, etc. Now that I know I can do that with positioning (fixed), I can make my website look better and also interact with the user in the way I want it to.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
I had a lot of trouble formatting the nav section.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
CSS is great because you can do class-wide work instead of individual formatting like html. I'd like to do more with adding elements when I get the chance.
